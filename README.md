# Simulations-of-squeezed-light-generation-with-waveguides

This repository consists of MATLAB scripts used to simulate the generation of squeezed light using waveguides. It considers second harmonic generation through to homodyne readout. These scripts are used to generate plots which detail how squeezing levels, power, waveguide parameters, losses and phase noise all interplay. 

The equations from which these simulations derive from as well as the the plots and their interpretations can be seen here [INSERT SOURCE].
